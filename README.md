## yawl-e
Yet Another Widget Library (Enhanced). An enhanced fork of YAWL, a Widget-based GUI library made by AR2000 that takes advantage of GPU VRAM buffering added in OpenComputers 1.7.6 for more advanced GUIs.
<br><br> To install and use yawl-e follow these instructions:
- install [oppm](https://ocdoc.cil.li/tutorial:program:oppm) and run the following commands (you can also copy and paste them into the terminal with the insert key)
- `oppm register AR2000AR/openComputers_codes`
- `oppm register Renno231/Renno-Programs`
- `oppm -f install yawl-e`

Once installed, yawl-e can be used with `require("yawl-e")` in your programs.
Here's an example of yawl-e in action in another project of mine.
