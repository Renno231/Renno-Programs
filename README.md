yawl-e: Yet Another Widget Library (Enhanced). An enhanced fork of YAWL, a Widget-based GUI library made by AR2000 that takes advantage of GPU VRAM buffering added in OpenComputers 1.7.6 for more advanced GUIs.
To install and use yawl-e follow these instructions:
  insert the OPPM floppy disk and run ``install``
  run ``oppm register AR2000AR/openComputers_codes``
  run ``oppm register Renno231/Renno-Programs``
  run ``oppm -f install yawl-e``
Once installed, yawl-e can be used with ``require("yawl-e")`` in your programs.
